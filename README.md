Description: from a TXT data source, the app evaluates the hands of two players and declares one the winner. The goal is to know how many hands Player 1 has won.

Data source prepared according to the following: "one-thousand random hands dealt to two players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single space): the first five are Player 1’s cards and the last five are Player 2’s cards." 

Pre-determined: all hands are valid (no invalid characters or repeated cards), each player’s hand is in no specific order, and in each hand there is a clear winner.
